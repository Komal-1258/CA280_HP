Before his term as President, he worked as an Aerospace engineer with Defence Research 
and Development Organization (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organization 
(ISRO).[1] Kalam is popularly known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the 
development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2] He played a pivotal 
organizational, technical and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the 
first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974. Some scientific experts have 
however called Kalam a man with no authority over nuclear physics but who just carried 
on the works of Homi J. Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai.[3]</p>
